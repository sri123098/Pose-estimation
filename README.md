# Pose-estimation

This project is mainly focused on the 2D pose estimation of
multiple people in an image and coming up with an intelligent
system to mimic the hand postures in Robot using servo motor.

It performs 2D pose estimation using part affinity fields and recognizes the motion and transfer the information to Robot using serial communication with the help of the Arduino interface.
